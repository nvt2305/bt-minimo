           <p>Society is constantly developing, but it cannot be denied that the development brings us a lot of negative
                environmental issues. Almost all of us have faced environmental pollution, but that problem sometimes is
                not serious enough for us to actually pay attention. Climate change and the greenhouse effect are always
                the keywords in most of the environmental pollution topics, but they are usually too big and vague for
                everyone to understand. To put it down in a simpler way</p>
